### Workflow of this analysis

## --> The first thing is to import the necessary libraries for the initial process which is to load the dataset.
## --> Then I went through the dataset to see if there are any missing or null values present.
## --> There are two categories for the sentiment in the dataset which is 'Positive' and 'Negative'.
## --> Next comes the pre - processing of the data. The tweets in the dataset has a lot of unwanted characters present in it which might complicate the model fitting process.
